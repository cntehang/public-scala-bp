  - It is essential to program like keyboard cat!
  - discuss six fundamental concepts that underly effective Scala; How can programmers quickly and effectively learn to write idiomatic Scala?
    - Expressions, types, and values
    - Objects and classes
    - Algebraic data types
    - Structural recursion
    - Sequencing computations
    - Type classes
  - Use type class, when you need common behavior, but do not have (useful) common type.
    (to achieve polymorphism without class hierarchy)
    (so called ad-hoc polymorphism)

## Slick

- [Polymorphic record types in a lifted embedding - by Stefan Zeiger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tS6N5AaZTLA)

  - Scala Days New York, 2016
  - an overview of the "lifted embedding" at the core of the Scala DSL in Slick.
  - "lifted embedding" is a tech to enable type check of target language in scala's type system
    - "embedding" means designing AST and writing interpreter in scala
    - "lifted" means `T` to `F[T]`

  - Do not pass mutable reference in message, use immutable message, for async call use "ask and pipe" pattern.
  - Do not always use flat actor hierarchies, use hierarchies and actor model's error handling, let it crash, "error should be handled out of band in a parallel process, they are not part of the main app."
  - Do not use too many actor systems, each actor system has at least one dispatcher backed by a thread pool.
  - Do not log to much, do not use block log, turn debug log off in production, do not log to file.
    - maybe [use elastic to aggregate logs](https://www.elastic.co/products/log-monitoring)
  - Do not use to much vm or docker, be close to hardware, it will be easier to config the dispatcher right.
  - Do not block, do not wait for future.
  - Do not use akka remoting, use akka cluster.
  - Do not use java serialization, use protobuf or Avro.
